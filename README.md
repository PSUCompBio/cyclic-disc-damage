Computational Model of Spinal Disc Degeneration (created by Vikram Subramani &amp; Shruti Motiwale)

The matlab code folder contains the Main.m file, which needs to be run in MATLAB.

Depending on which loading case you want to run, copy the appropriate .mat file from the matlab data folder into the matlab code folder. 

On Line 12 of Main.m, set the number of years you want to run the damage model for. (Default: 80)

On Line 15 and Line 17 of Main.m, change the name of the loading input data to any of the available data in the matlab data folder.

On Line 16, set the number of steps/cycles taken in a day for the chosen loading condition. (Default: 9000)

The damage plot is automatically generated by the Main.m function in MATLAB.
